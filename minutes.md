Make the player to read in the chess board, update opponent player's move and execute move.

#meeting 2
5.1 7:30 p.m. - 9:00 p.m.
Discuss algorithms to use:
Min-Max in total.
Need to build a score rule for min-max.

#meeting 3
5.6 3.30 p.m. - 6.00 p.m., 7.00 p.m. - 10.45 p.m.
Begin working on Minimax with alpha-beta pruning algorithms,
and modify the data structure we used.

#meeting 4
5.7 5.00 p.m. - 6.30 p.m., 7.30 p.m. - 11.00 p.m.
Almost finish Minimax algorithms and fix some bugs.
For the heuristic, we decided to use TDLeaf(lambda), need more discussion on it.
